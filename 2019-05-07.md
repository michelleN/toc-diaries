# Prep + Notes:

## SIGs: Security/Governance

## NATs
- Requesting to graduate
- longstanding project - around for 9+ years
- graduation requirements [here](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc)
- PR [reviewed](https://github.com/cncf/toc/projects/2)
  - concern around core maintainers all being from one company
  - question on whether each repo needs a code of conduct doc
- What is the process around raising and resolving security issues in the core server? - not documented. CNCF/TOC should prescribe and make that part of CII

## OpenTelemetry (OpenTracing + OpenCensus merging)
- sandbox vs. incubation
  - incubation makes most sense to me but project is comfortable being sandbox for now. these are projects that are already well used. we are picking a winner hear and not trying to be neutral about it.
  - TOC is comfortable with sandbox for now and incubate whenever
  - also personally feel OpenTracing was already an incubating project and this is simply an envolution

## CloudEvents Annual Review
- bumped to next next meeting

## Archiving Projects
- looks good.
- the reactivation process says you can open a project back up but I'm not clear if we recommend a level they bring it back as?

## Graduation Criteria for Specs
- bumped to next meeting
- I think we should require one reference implementation, information on at least 2 other implementations describing use case and how end users of those implementations.
- What we should be looking for is that the specification in stable and unambigious (reference implementation helps with that and versioning info), holds up in different scenarios and is widely adopted meaning lots of people in the end (end users of the implementations) are making use of it.

## CVE Discussion
- bumped to next meeting

## Open Q&A
